The Hangman game is a Python terminal game deployed to Heroku. The goal of this game is to guess the secret word with one letter at a time. If the player guess it's wrong to many times the man hangs. If the player guess the word the man survives.

## User Experience

### User Goals
As a user I want:
- First of all to have a simple fun game and be challenged.
- Secondly, to learn how to play and understand the game.
- To play the game without any issues, if an invalid input occurs the player get's to know what is wrong with an error message.
- To be challenged with randomised words and diffrent levels of difficulty.
- To easily navigate through available options and have clear feedback on my inputs.
- To know if I won the game or not and what the secret word was.

### Project Goals
As a programmer of the game, I want the user to meet their goals (above). I also want the game to run smoothly with no bugs.

## Flowchart
I was using a Flowchart to plan out how the code should work. My thoughts while doing this was:
- How should the game start?
- Where should it be inputs from the user?
- How do I deal with incorrect input?
